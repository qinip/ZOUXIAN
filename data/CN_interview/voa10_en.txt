Our family of four went abroad in 2019. The main reason was the poor economic environment. We are engaged in e-commerce, specifically selling sports-related products. Our sales have been declining, getting worse every year. In the beginning, I could sell millions in a year, then it dropped to one million, and eventually just a few hundred thousand per year. These figures represent sales revenue, not net profit. There's a saying, "A prosperous country and strong people," but now it seems like "A prosperous country and poor ordinary people." The ordinary people no longer have the purchasing power, they have no money in their pockets.

We don't plan to go back before coming out. Because the children should go to school, one is 4 years old, the other is 6 years old, and we don't want them to receive this brainwashing education in China, saying that only the Communist Party can save China and so on. So we choose to take the children abroad to study.

The first stop we made was Thailand, through studying abroad. When preparing to go home for the Lunar New Year, I couldn't contact some of my friends, and they mysteriously disappeared. Some of them had jobs, some were working part-time, and some were doing business. Later, I found out through others that they had been arrested. It was because they often posted comments online that the Communist Party considered unfavorable. Some were detained and taken to the police station for interrogation, where they were forced to admit to alleged crimes.

I have also made similar comments online. When I was in college, my classmates downloaded videos of the Tiananmen Square incident from the internet. We all watched them and felt shocked and incredulous. Suddenly, I felt that the world I lived in was so dirty, and I couldn't express my anger in words.

After my friend was arrested, I became afraid and dared not return to my home country. We didn't go back for the Lunar New Year in 2019. Instead, we went to Africa in April or May. We stayed in Kenya and Morocco for two years. Because those African countries do not have a way to provide you with legal status, and their relationship with the Communist Party is still very good, we were also worried.

This year (2021), we started heading north from Ecuador. Our first stop was Colombia, where we entered the jungle. Our 6-year-old child understood almost everything. We said we were going on a jungle adventure. We expected the trip to last 5 days, but in reality, we stayed in the jungle for a week. After two days of traveling in Colombia, we ran out of money. Without money, no one would take us further. We were forced to stay in Pito and went to nearby villages where people gave us food. We sold the laptop we had with us for $300, and then we hit the road again.

Afterwards, we passed through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, and then it was Mexico. We followed the caravan for two days, but it was really exhausting, hot and tiring. The children suffered too, so we bought a pedal motorcycle for 16,000 pesos, which is about 800 US dollars, and the four of us hit the road. We rode for 11 days and covered over 2,400 kilometers. Now we have finally arrived at the (United States) border. We didn't tell our family back home, thinking that we would inform them after successfully entering the United States, so as not to worry them.
