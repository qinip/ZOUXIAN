If you can use a pseudonym, call me Hannah, please do not use my surname. I am 36 years old, I studied my undergraduate degree in the United States and have been working in Beijing for five to six years. I have worked as a journalist and all my previous jobs were related to the media. I left China in August 2020, went to Denmark first, and now I am studying for a master's degree in Prague.

In the early stages of the epidemic, I returned to my country from Indonesia. As soon as I landed, there were various registrations and I had to undergo home quarantine. At that time, residential areas were already being sealed off, and entry and exit required permits. Later, as the epidemic became more severe, seeing terms like "lockdown" would evoke a sense of insecurity. You probably know that an authoritarian government can take various measures in such situations.

At that time, I had already started seeing people online saying that (going abroad) might become more restricted. The epidemic showed no signs of ending in the short term, and I didn't know when it would be over. I felt that if I didn't leave quickly, I might not be able to leave temporarily. I was very fortunate to have left at that time. At that time, there was no mention of "non-essential travel restrictions," so I didn't encounter too many troubles when going through customs.

Have you ever experienced being hit by an iron fist in China? Many times! For example, when you go online, your posts may inexplicably be deleted, and you are unable to speak, or your account gets banned. Even something as simple as speaking carries such a great risk. This includes many practices during the current pandemic, such as how to get a nucleic acid test or a travel permit, which are all absurd.

Most of my friends around me also work in the media industry. From what I know, some people have already left, and some are preparing to leave, maybe within the next year or two. I have created a Telegram group, hoping that female friends who also want to go to Europe can get to know each other. Many people have contacted me.

When it comes to the reasons for wanting "liquidity," everyone has their own pain. It's a kind of insecurity, unless you really have privileges. Policies have various uncertainties. If there is any policy change that affects you, then you have no way out, just like the recent financial collapse in Henan. When it happens to you, there is no way out either.

After leaving, I feel like I have exhausted my connection with China. Whether it was the past hurts or the suppression, I just don't want to live a repressed life anymore. I just want to move on and look forward, because you can't change anything anyway.

If I were to choose again, I would definitely choose "Run". I believe this decision is correct. In the future, when discussing China-related issues, I hope to observe them from the perspective of a researcher, treating them as subjects of study, without feeling any personal connection to them.
