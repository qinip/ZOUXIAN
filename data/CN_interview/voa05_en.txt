My name is Xue Yinxian, and I am 84 years old this year. I worked as a team doctor at the National Sports Administration for 36 years. Since the 1980s, I have been opposing the use of performance-enhancing drugs for Chinese national team athletes, and as a result, I was persecuted. At that time, I fell seriously ill, had blood in my urine, and my son used this as a reason to seek medical treatment abroad. Five years ago, I came to Germany and applied for political asylum here.

I am very satisfied with my life in Germany, just like Bai Juyi said, "I was born without a hometown, but my heart finds peace here." The people here are very friendly and treat others sincerely, unlike in China where people are always on guard when speaking to each other. The Cultural Revolution has made people unkind.

Chen Zhanghao (former team doctor of the Chinese national team) was sent to France in 1979 to study. After returning, he openly advocated the benefits of using performance-enhancing drugs in various meetings. His goal was clear: to target the top athletes of whichever team and get them to use these substances.

The team doctors dare not speak, but I cannot remain silent. Doping is what patients take, it's hormones, given to patients as a life-saving measure. If it's administered to healthy athletes, they will become sick even if they weren't before. Because I opposed giving injections to athletes, in 1988 I was isolated and placed under house arrest. In one year, 82 meetings were held, and everyone ganged up on me.

I was originally the head of the Medical Supervision Team, overseeing around 30 people. At that time, they removed me from my position as the team leader. Afterwards, they avoided taking medication in front of me, and even the athletes were afraid to talk to me. Perhaps it was an order from above.

I like taking notes, and I write quickly. Every day, I record things next to the training field. From 1963 to 1988, I have written a total of 68 work diaries. After the Chen Zhanghao incident, I also started keeping records of meetings. I remember everything that anyone says, just to see who tells the truth and who tells lies.

They want me to hand over my diary, but they haven't been successful despite trying many methods. Why should I give them my diary? So they spread rumors, find foreign journalists to interview me, and say that Xue Yinxian's notebook is fake. They say Xue Yinxian is not a doctor, just a masseuse. I say you nonsense child, have you ever read my diary? When I was writing my diary, you didn't even know where you were.

Because we opposed doping, our whole family has been suppressed. Both my husband and I have suffered from cerebrovascular diseases and are bedridden. He had a brain tumor and underwent surgery. The officials from the Chinese National Sports Administration came to visit me, but they used the excuse of visiting me to push and shove him (my husband, Yang Ketong), causing him to fall and hit his head, resulting in his death.

My eldest son and his spouse took over and shouldered everything. He is the pillar of our family, protecting me from wind and rain. So, in the end, the National Sports Commission turned its spearhead towards my eldest son. They targeted him, not allowing him to go abroad, not allowing him to work. He opened a caf√©, but there were spies sitting there, drinking tea. No one dared to enter. They have already brought our family to ruin, and my eldest son was imprisoned for 114 days, just because he opposed doping.

I just love standing up for justice and speaking my mind. Taking performance-enhancing drugs is stealing from world athletes. Stealing, it's stealing gold medals!

After I came to Germany, all the benefits were taken away from me. They specifically sent me a text message to inform me that all the benefits were cut off. Because of this, I was very upset and decided to quit the party. I have dedicated my entire youth to the party. Life here in Germany is very peaceful, with liberated thinking and less political interference. Home is where I should take care of my old age, just like roots returning to the fallen leaves.
