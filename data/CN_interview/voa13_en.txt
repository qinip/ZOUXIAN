My name is Li Mou, I am from Shandong, China. In April, I traveled through more than ten countries from Singapore and arrived in New York around May. So, when I last heard you talking about this route, I was already on the same journey

I have a serious doubt about this process, even risking my life. Why did you choose to take this path? Regarding this path, I have spent three to four years trying to understand this matter. The most striking thing for me in my country is the increasing strict scrutiny and suppression of civil liberties

There is also the issue of children. Because of my previous experience with the government's detention and the destruction caused by the people inside, I have a deep sense of dissatisfaction with the government. Therefore, I do not want my next generation to be born in this environment, especially when in the past 13 years, a few security guards can control the distribution of vegetables in the entire community, preventing residents from receiving them and forcing them to buy expensive vegetables. There is also a series of control measures imposed on the public. This place feels very suffocating. Regarding children, I want to emphasize that my child..

Once I went to the school and saw what my child was doing. There was a cultural evening organized by the teacher. We discovered that our children were on stage, carrying explosive packages, pretending to be heroes and detonating missiles. I was extremely shocked and said, "You are running a school, and you claim to educate and teach, right?"

Isn't this cultivating terrorists? Letting children carry explosive packages to bomb missiles, I strongly oppose this. I strongly dislike this approach. I don't want it. I hope that one day children won't have to rush to the frontlines. I hope that adults will do this instead. What's the point of doing it this way?

Right, so from that time, I made up my mind and said that I must come out. I know that this path is very difficult and also very dangerous. That's why I left my children in my home country and came out on my own, paving the way for them

I cannot sacrifice my life just to leave something behind for my children. Because I don't even know where this path will lead me. Even if I have no money, I told my wife that I would rather die on the road pursuing freedom

Let us leave behind the hardships of a country and embark on the road to freedom in the United States. I said this to my wife. Did you ever think about what you would experience on this journey? Things that we couldn't imagine before or even now find hard to imagine. I felt lost before setting off because when I was in Singapore, my colleagues advised me. They said, "You have finally come to Singapore after spending so much money and stabilizing your work in all aspects. Your colleagues and boss also appreciate you."

Why do you still want to embark on such a difficult path? I told them that at our age, we can live comfortably and be content, and life can be good. But that was not my original intention. I hope that the next generation can live in a safe, free, and nurturing environment. That's why I have to take this inevitable path. Singapore may be great, but it is not the ultimate destination I want to reach. So, I understand that I don't know what lies ahead on this road, but I must go and keep moving forward forever

So, in simple terms, it means that you actually feel that due to the limited freedom of speech in your country and the various controls during the outbreak, especially the behavior of your child carrying an explosive device at school, you feel that such a country makes you feel that your child has a limited future. Therefore, for this reason,

You choose to live this way, risking your life, and you have to come out, right? That's how it is
