I was born in 1996, and my hometown is in Anhui Province, located in a mountainous area where mountains surround us. When I was young, I had to walk several kilometers on mountain roads to reach our school. It was a relatively impoverished region.

When I was young, my parents went to work in other places like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In China, there is a term called "left-behind children," which refers to children who stay in their hometown with their grandparents. I grew up with my paternal grandparents during my childhood.

The entire middle school period was completely devoted to being a "little pink" - an internet troll, a "50-cent party" member. I often engaged in online arguments with others. When I was young, I thought it was fun and honorable, feeling proud to fight for my country. I can only say that I was too young and didn't see the true nature of the outside world.

I studied at a university in Hainan. In my sophomore year, I had the opportunity to go to Taiwan as an exchange student. I stayed there for 4 months and saw many things that I couldn't see in China before, which gradually broadened my horizons.

Many people who watch my videos leave comments saying that I must be a Taiwanese person pretending to be someone else, saying that I have a Taiwanese accent. Because I really love Taiwan, I speak with a Taiwanese accent. On my channel, I say that I am a "spiritual Taiwanese" from China.

I think Taiwan is a Chinese society full of warmth and justice. There is not much distrust between people. People often say that Chinese people are not suitable for democracy, but Taiwan is a good example. If Taiwan continues to exist, it will always be a slap in the face, so they hope for the reunification of Taiwan.

The first time I "ran" to South Korea was because I was arrested in China. At that time, I had graduated and rented a house in Sanya with a roommate. We both knew how to "climb the wall" and had software for it, which was recorded as evidence. The charge they eventually gave me was "providing programs and tools for invading and illegally controlling computer information systems," claiming that I taught others on Twitter how to bypass China's internet firewall.

At that time, they said the results would be out in a month, but it kept getting delayed until the end of the year without any outcome. This long six months was extremely difficult to endure because I didn't know what my fate would be. Later on, they also told me that within three generations, my son, daughter, and even the next generation of my son and daughter would be influenced by me.

Actually, at that time, I never even thought about studying abroad. But over there, every day was a struggle, not knowing what to do next. So, I thought, why not give it a try and go study abroad.

They told me right from the beginning that you are not allowed to go abroad. He said, you are not allowed to leave the country within this year. I also searched a lot of information online, and many experts there also said that "according to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, a person under residential surveillance is not allowed to leave the country". I just wanted to give it a try, even if I get caught while leaving, it doesn't matter, because this is the only chance.

I didn't encounter much trouble at the immigration checkpoint, and they didn't inquire about my experience of being arrested and detained in Hainan. It took about an hour, during which they carefully examined my passport. Finally, they stamped my exit seal, wished me a smooth journey, and let me go.

When I walked to the customs and started inspecting my luggage, I felt like I had already passed. But at that moment, I heard the immigration officer who had just checked me calling my name. I immediately became nervous. Honestly, I felt like it was all over. My heart sank, and my mind went blank. I dropped both bags on the ground with a loud thud.

The person slowly walked over and when he reached my side, he said, "Sorry, Mr. Chen, here's your boarding pass." Oh, so it turns out I forgot to take my boarding pass.

I arrived in South Korea on December 31, 2020, which was also the last day of leaving China in 2020, and it has been until now.

After I went to South Korea, at first I didn't plan to make the (arrested experience) public, I just felt quite suppressed. Because only I knew about this matter, and I kept it to myself. Then I thought about sharing it. I don't think it's too much, right? You arrested me, can't I talk about it?

But I didn't expect it to have a bigger impact later on, and many media outlets reposted it. After I had been out for three months, they called me. The local police station in our hometown also contacted my family. They sent a group of police cars, and the villagers all gathered around. Wow, I wonder what big event happened in this family. My grandmother was really scared. Elderly people's health is already not good. She didn't know if I had killed someone or set a fire outside, and she felt quite embarrassed.

My bank card was frozen when I was in China. They said it would be frozen for six months, and then it would be unfrozen. But because I appeared in the news, they asked me to go back to handle the case. I didn't respond positively, so it was frozen again. If you are studying abroad and cannot pay tuition fees, or if your visa expires and cannot be renewed, China will not come to arrest you. Other countries will directly deport you. So I think they have thought it through quite well.

During the pandemic, I opened the world map and the whole world was dark. All countries were black, and you couldn't go anywhere. Entry was temporarily suspended. At that time, I saw that there was only one country open, and that was the United States. So, I took a final gamble and decided to go to the United States in September 2021.
 No one likes to leave their hometown, it's always out of necessity.
