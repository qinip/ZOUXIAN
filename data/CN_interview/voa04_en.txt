I am from mainland China and I am 48 years old. Before "Run" came out, I was engaged in equity investment business in China.

I was born in the late period of the Cultural Revolution. I have never met my grandfather, grandmother, paternal grandfather, or paternal grandmother. They are the typical people who did not "run" away in 1949.

In 1949, they all had some family property and were defined as landlords by the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, they chose to believe the propaganda and stayed behind, but they suffered hardships during the "Three-Anti Five-Anti" campaign, the Great Famine, and the Cultural Revolution.

I grew up in a small town in northern Jiangsu, where both of my parents were intellectuals. That small town in northern Jiangsu is famous nationwide for its college entrance examination. I received my undergraduate and graduate education in mainland China, which I consider the result of my own hard work and perseverance.

After graduation, I had the opportunity to join a well-known multinational company and become a sales director. I also had the chance to receive training abroad and had the opportunity to stay and work in the United States. However, at that time, I was still relatively young and lacked broad experience. Moreover, I was unaware of the tragic experiences that my grandparents' generation had endured, so I chose to return to China.

At that time, China was enjoying a demographic dividend, and we had the opportunity to join the World Trade Organization. The global environment was relatively friendly towards China. For us, as recent graduates, we felt that there were still many opportunities ahead.

Around 2011, China vigorously encouraged the listing of private enterprises. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I established my own private equity fund, combining my background and experience in multinational corporations. We focus on supporting the innovative development of small and medium-sized enterprises, with managed funds exceeding 5 billion RMB.

The low point has been these past few years. Starting from 2017, we have witnessed a wave receding. Social control at the national level has been strengthening day by day. Now, it can be said that we have reached a point of no return.

China has exacerbated the epidemic, causing many businesses to suffer a lot in the past two to three years. We always thought that today was the hardest day, and tomorrow would be better, but we ended up realizing that tomorrow might be even worse than today.

The Zhao family still controls the lifeline of various industries. In fact, we all know: you are not the owner of wealth, you are just holding it on behalf of others. This money is not yours, I just let you keep it in your pocket. Your money will be the target of plunder in the future. Because our financial deficit is so large, where does this money come from? It comes from the pockets of the elite class. There are many ways to get it from you. Knock on your door, and you will hand over the money. The previous foreign exchange control policies may have had various ways to transfer money out, but now it is necessary to keep the money within the country.

After realizing this, if I don't leave now, I will basically be a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. The rulers are wearing the emperor's new clothes, calling a deer a horse, instilling fear in people, and frequently imposing lockdowns. People's limits have already been tested. So why has "lubrication" now become a subject of study, with theories and implementation methods?

Recently, there was a statement from a well-known blogger online: "If you don't lubricate for 49 years, it's your grandfather's fault. If you don't lubricate now, your descendants will say you made a big mistake, if you still have any descendants."

I have not yet "moistened" to an ideal destination. I hope to go to a more free country, ensuring freedom without fear for myself and my family. By that time, I also want to write down the experiences of my family and leave them as a testimony to history.
